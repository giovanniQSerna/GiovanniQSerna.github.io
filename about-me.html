The skills throughout the years that I have learned would have to be adaptability because I am able to work under any circumstances and I work well with others by communicating with teammates and discussing on what should and shouldn't be done within a certain subject. finally is my accomplishments and one of my achievements is getting better grades from last and this year keeping everything high to do well for career wise and for my choice of colleges or Universities depending on what happens in the future as time passes by. </th>
